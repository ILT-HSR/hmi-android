.. kotlin:interface:: Platform

The interface of drivers for a given 'Platform'

Generally, a platform is some sort of unmanned vehicle, be it drones, submarines, rovers, etc.
Each platform provides a number of commands and queries that can be performed by the platform.
Additionally, a platform may be coupled to a payload, which allows for payload specific tasks
that can be performed. Payloads are accessed through payload drivers, an the attached payloads
can be queried through the platform itself.

This interface specifies the minimal subset of commands and queries shared by all supported
platforms.
