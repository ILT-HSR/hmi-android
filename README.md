- **Commit Messages** - Outline a broad description of your change in the first line of your commit,
and keep it short.
- **Issue Tracking** - Please update/adjust issues you are working on. If your feature is not described in an issue yet, please create a new issue. This also holds if you find a bug or have a feature request without wanting to contribute.
